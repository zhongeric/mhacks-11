Put the person on his or her back on a firm surface
Kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders
Place the heel of one hand over the center of the person's chest between the nipples
Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands
Use your upper body weight (not just your arms) as you push straight down on (compress) the chest at least 2 inches (approximately 5 centimeters) but not greater than 2.4 inches (approximately 6 centimeters). Push hard at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute
If you've performed 30 chest compressions open the person's airway using the head-tilt chin-lift maneuver put your palm on the person's forehead and gently tilt the head back
With the other hand gently lift the chin forward to open the airway
With the airway open (using the head-tilt chin-lift maneuver) pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing
Cover the person's mouth with yours making a seal
Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give the first rescue breath — lasting one second — and watch to see if the chest rises. If it does rise give the second breath. If the chest doesn't rise repeat the head-tilt chin-lift maneuver and then give the second breath. Thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one cycle. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force
Resume chest compressions to restore circulation
As soon as an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available  apply it and follow the prompts. Administer one shock  then resume CPR — starting with chest compressions — for two more minutes before administering a second shock. If you're not trained to use an AED  a 911 or other emergency medical operator may be able to guide you in its use. If an AED isn't available continue CPR
Continue CPR until there are signs of movement or emergency medical personnel take over
